# eTuitionBD: Tuition Management System

## Project Overview

The Tuition Management System is a complete platform designed to bring students, tutors, and administrators together in one digital space. It allows students to post tuition requirements, tutors to apply for classes, and admins to oversee and regulate all activities. The system simplifies the process of finding qualified tutors, ensures verified tuition posts, and provides smooth communication and payment tracking.

## Purpose

Finding the right tutor or tuition can often be confusing and time-consuming. This platform solves real problems by:

- Helping students find verified, qualified tutors easily.
- Reducing friction between students and tutors with automated workflows.
- Enabling digital tracking of classes, transparent payment processing, and structured communication.
- Supporting admins in monitoring, regulating, and managing the overall system efficiently.

## Features

- **Student Portal**: Register, post tuition requirements (class, subject, schedule, budget, location), and track tutor applications.
- **Tutor Portal**: Browse tuition posts, apply to suitable classes, and communicate with students.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Verify tutors, approve or reject tuition posts, handle disputes, and monitor platform performance.
- **Secure Payments**: Track tuition payments and manage finances transparently.
- **Communication Tools**: Built-in messaging for students and tutors to coordinate effectively.

## How It Works (Workflow)

1. A student registers and posts a tuition requirement.
2. Tutors browse available posts and apply for the ones that match their skills.
3. Admin reviews tutor applications, verifies credentials, and approves or rejects posts.
4. Admin oversees the platform, manages disputes, and monitors overall performance.
